## Introduction

This mod gives an option to make the build mode similar to blueprint mode, which can make things more clear and avoid inconvenience when building on darkside of the planet.

After enabled this mod, when you enter build mode a checkbox will appear on the bottom-right corner of your screen, check it to enable white mode in build mode, uncheck it to restore to default.
